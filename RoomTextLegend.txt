Hello. You must wonder how the room text file is organized. If that is the case, then I'll help you out.

Let's take a look at a few lines from the Room text file.
This is the order for each room provided in the game and will not differ.
The arrows pointing to the lines are what attributes they go into.

R02                         <- roomID (String)
Underground Chapel          <- roomName (String)
This room is to the west... <- roomDesc (String)
E R01 S R11                 <- exits (HashMap<String, String>)
Easy                        <- difficulty (String)
AR02                        <- artifactID (String)
M01                         <- monsterID (String)
P01                         <- puzzleID (String)


If there is a blank amongst the artifact, monster, and/or puzzle line, then that room does not have that specific
attribute located in that room.

The exit directions are always in the North, East, West, South order. If the exit is missing one or more of these
directions, then it simply does not have that direction.

The game will hold the value of how many times the player visited the room. That value is not pulled from the text file.

Hopefully this helps when needing to prepare the read file class or understanding the text file in general.

Cheers!
